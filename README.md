# Bright Canopy Website

*This repository is deprecated. All new development is in a BitBucket repository.*


Bright Canopy is an application streaming service which allows users of Second Life and Open Sim to run SL viewers in their web browser.

This repository was the landing page and website for the project, but we are now using a different repository on BitBucket.

This website based on Drew, A Multipurpose Landing Page Template, designed by David Rozando (http://design.davidrozando.com) contact him for licensing of the template.

Our branching approach may be of interest for its simplicity and handling an outage page through git, and also a simple piece of code under "Frame AJAX" in n js/scripts.js which handles submitting the form input to both the Mailchimp and our backend service provider registration API.
